# Seating-Allocation-Algorithm
<br>
<b>Language: C++</b>
<br>
As a group of 5, we wrote a program for allocating seats in a plane with the sections ‘Family and Children’ and ‘Men’, based on a set of pre-informed rules for allocation.
<br>
The program includes displaying the Menu, creating new Seating plan, displaying the current Plan, resetting and retreiving previous plans.
<br>
Vectors were used to create the algorithm.
